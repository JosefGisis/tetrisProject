HOW TO PLAY
_____________

>  Game objective: earn points to get a new high score!

>  Guide falling tetrominos by shifting them right or left of by rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise.

>  Instantly drop falling tetromino by performing a hard drop or speed up its descent by performing a fast drop.

>  Get 10 points for every dropped piece.

>  Clear space by completing rows.

>  Get 100 points for completing 1 row, 300 points for completing 2 rows, 500 points for completing 3 rows, and 700 points for completing 4 rows (AKA getting a Tetris).

>  The game is over once there is no longer any room to drop the tetromino and it exceeds the top of the play surface.

>  Good luck!

GAMEPLAY TIPS
_______________

>  Keep low: try to place tetrominos as flat as possible (e.g. try not to place an i piece vertically unless it is filling a gap). The lower the stack, the further away you will be from the top of the play surface, and the more time you will have to move.

>  Keep a close eye on the upcoming tetromino. The next tetromino will help you decide where to place the current tetromino.

>  Game difficulty increases based on the number of lines completed, not the score, so try to fill multiple rows at a time. The more lines you fill at once, the more points you get per a line, so aim for a Tetris where you can. To do this, stack tetrominos throughout the play surface while leaving the rightmost column empty. Fill in the rightmost column when ready.

>  Do not chase a Tetris at the expense of your current game layout.

>  The deeper the gap, the harder it is to fill. When a gap is two squares deep, it can be filled with the l, j, and i piece. When it is three squares deep, it can only be filled with the i piece.

>  Use hard drop sparingly. The hard drop eliminates the grace period where the player can still make momentary adjustments after the tetromino has landed. The grace period gives the user more time to plan the next tetromino's placement, so try to use fast drop instead.
